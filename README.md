# Geological Features Ontology
This OWL ontology describes classes of geologic/geological feature relevant to the duties of the Geological Survey of Queensland.

Elements of this ontology are designed to fit within other, broader, ontologies, in particular [Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) Ontologies](https://github.com/ESIPFed/sweet) ontologies. 

The core of this ontology is a class hierarchy starting with \"geologic province\", as it is defined in SWEET, and extending down into multiple subclasses of it.
