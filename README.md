# SWEET Geological Features Profile Ontology
This OWL ontology describes classes of geologic/geological feature relevant to the duties of the Geological Survey of Queensland.

Elements of this ontology are designed to fit within other, broader, ontologies, in particular [Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) Ontologies](https://github.com/ESIPFed/sweet) ontologies. 

The core of this ontology is a clacc hierarchy starting with \"geologic province\", as it is defined in SWEET, and exnteding down into multiple subclasses of it.


## Online
This ontology is accessible via its persistent URI:

## Repository Contents
This repository contains both the machine-readable ontology file in the RDF Turtle format, [geofeatures.ttl](sweetgeofeatures.ttl), and an HTML web page version of it for people to use [geofeatures.html](geofeatures.html).
