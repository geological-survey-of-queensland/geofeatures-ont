  dcterms:description """This ontology describes classes of geological and administrative feature relevant to the duties of the Geological Survey of Queensland.

As subclasses of the GeoSPARQL Ontology's `Feature` class, this ontology defines `Geological Feature` and `Administrative Feature`. Multiple subclasses of those two main classes are also defined.

Most of the subclasses of `Geological Feature` defined here are not disjoint with other subclasses of it in recognition of the fact that a real-world `Feature` may be classed in multiple ways. `Administrative Feature` subclasses, however, are all disjoint having been defined disjointly by people.

References to and positioning of other Features defined elsewhere are made, such as placing the HY_Features model's `Catchment` and `CatchmentAggregate` classes as subclasses of this ontology's `Basin` class (a subclass of `Geological Feature`). As a result, the classes of object within the LocI project's Geofabric dataset can be related to objects classified using this ontology."""@en ;
